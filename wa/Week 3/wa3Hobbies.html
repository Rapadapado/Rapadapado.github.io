            <h2>Traveling</h2>
            <p>
                I didn't always like to get out of my cave of my room and look what the outside world had for me. Had a great 
                friend take me out when I was down and has been part of my life to be able to explore and take time for one's
                self and for the health too

            <h2>Art and Storytelling</h2>
            <p>
                I have added art as a new thing along side storytelling, since I like to give audeience a look at the world or
                people in the content created. I like to create stories on my free time, stuff to little comic strips that give
                a poke at people, to making Game Design Documents on video games that I would like to make in the furture.

            <h2>Basketball</h2>
            <p>
                I love the sport basketball since I was little, and the saying
                 <q>
                Be like Mike
                </q>
                has always been with me. Used to be made fun of for how many time I stuck out my tongue during games I played.
                I did also tryout for the NBA E-League once I knew I was not going to be able to pursue basketball. Even though
                I was not lucky to make it into any leagues, was happy to participate twice when I was able to show off my skills.
                Now just like to play around or use it as an excersize.

            <h2>Video and Card Games</h2>
            <p>
                Another deep passion of mine since I have been a kid, and also notice that I tryed out an E-League even. I love
                how games bring people together and gives a chance for people to try something that they my not have tryed out
                in different scenarios. I believe games are a new source of telling a story and gives the player a experence that
                they can direct as well.
