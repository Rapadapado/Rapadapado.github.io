        <p>The API I used was what quotes were in a movie. Even though when messing with the id's of the API, it was very miss leading
          and was more of Author's who wrote the quote instead of which movie the quote was in. Wasn't able to get it to work, had to use
          a GET way for it to have access to it. But did try different ways to do it, but the way in class was able to give me more feedback
          then the ways they have showed online.
          API would help in my project in a way the is suppose to be random and spontanous, able to find a discover moment while still able
          to get into the content that you enjoyed as well. I think I would use it differently, in a sense of also showing images. But can 
          be diffcult if need to place all the information by hand.
