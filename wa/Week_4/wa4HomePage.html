                    Welcome to one stop page to get to know me. I started my interest in design when I was able to help out in the 2018 
                    Winter Olypmics in Pyeongchang. It was so cool to create something that would be seen all around the world, and
                    still riding that moment. I am a big fan of Video Games, and spent a few years as well trying to get my foot into
                    eports. I was close, almost got into the 2K NBA League, but was not able to get into the draft section. When I went
                    back to school I went for Video Game Development, and love Designing and Development of the whole process. Right now,
                    on my way on earning a bachelor's of science in Creative Technology and Design, hopfully be able to add onto the skills.
